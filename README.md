# barcode_maker v1.0
This program is written to convert a purchase order number into a barcode that can be scanned. 
The idea is to have this project scaled for businesses who process a lot of orders for shipment and print labels to UPS or Fedex type of printers. 
This describes the very initial phase of this project. It is still an executable .py file. This program contains some simple features: 
First, the ability to accept input for a 12-digit purchase order number.
Then, it converts that number into a barcode using the EAN13 format. 
After that, it saves the barcode as an image in .png format onto a specified folder in the computer C: drive.
